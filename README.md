# Introduction
Ubuntu 18.04-based VSCode development container for [ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)
and [ORB_SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3) based projects with all dependencies preinstalled including
ROS Melodic and `ccache` to speed up builds.

This can also be used as a standalone dev container without VSCode, you'll just need to manually build the container.

Works on Apple M1 Pro.

Make sure to set the correct `platform` value in the compose file to match your system.
